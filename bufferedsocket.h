/**
    Base class for sending and receiving data send as PacketBuffers.

    When data is sent, not all data is garenteed to be sent in the one call. 
    (See man page for send(3) for details.)

    When data is read, or received, not all the data is garenteed to be 
    read in one recv call. (See man page for recv(3) for details.)

    To make life easier, the functionality for sending and receiving an 
    entire PacketBuffer object, without multiple calls to send()/recv() is 
    wrapped up in this object. 

    Also, if 3 packets were sent, but only 2 1/2 were read, BufferedSocket will
    parse out the two, and keep the data from 3 till the next call.

    \todo Verify it's send(3) and not send(2).
