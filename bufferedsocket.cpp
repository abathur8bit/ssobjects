    You are gerented to receive a full PacketBuffer object.

    When data is read in, some verification is done to ensure that the packet header is 
    valid. There is no way to validate the buffer portion of the packet. A test is done
    on the header to see if the cookie (just a constant value passed all the time) and
    to see the the command looks like it might be valid. There is no way to tell other then 
    if the command is zero (PacketBuffer::pcInvalid). Note that a common problem with getting 
    PacketBuffer::pcInvalid as a command is not setting the command in a packet before sending
    it.

    If a packet is sent with a size greater then 3000 bytes, the read operation will
    reset the internal buffer, and throw an exception. This is done to prevent bogus packets
    overflowing the buffer.
