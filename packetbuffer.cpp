   The most commonly used packet constructor. You usually construct passing in

   "pc" part of "pcPing" stands for Packet Command. Normally, if you need
   additional packet commands, you create a new class, and dirive it from
   PacketBuffer. For instance:

   <pre>

   class mypackets : public PacketBuffer
   {

       pcBackflip = pcUser,     //start at user, don't start at anything below,
