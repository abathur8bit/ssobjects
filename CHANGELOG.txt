September 22, 2001

Fixed potential overflow problem in
ServerSocket::extractPacket method. If a size is read is
larger then the maximum buffer size indicated when the
ServerSocket is created, an exception is
thrown. SimpleServer modified to handle this exception.

Wrapped all objects in a namespace called "ssobjects" to
avoid any naming conflicts.

"EasyFile" object renamed to "File", now that I am using
namespaces.
