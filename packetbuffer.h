/**
   \brief
   Packet object used for storing data that is sent or received.

   The packet object is the base class for storing any information you indend to
   send, and when data is received, it is put into a PacketBuffer object. The object
   has operators for storing and extracting 8, 16 or 32 bit numbers, as well as
   zero terminated strings and CStr objects.

   To store data in the packet, you would typically construct the packet with
   the command type, and then insert data into it via the "<<" operator. For
   example:
   <pre>
   ...
   PacketBuffer ping(PacketBuffer::pcAuthenticate);
   unsigned32 nVersion = 100; //version 1.00
   ping << "lpatterson";      //user name
   ping << "mypassword";      //password
   ping << 100;               //version
   ...

   The server would extract the data like this:

   ...
   pPacket = psocket->recvPacket();
   CStr sUserName;
   CStr sPassword;
   unsigned32 nVersion;
   *pPacket >> sUserName;
   *pPacket >> sPassword;
   *pPacket >> nVersion;
   ...
   </pre>
**/
class PacketBuffer 
{
  public:
    /**
       These enums are provided for convience. When you construct a new Packet
       object, you will pass a packet command listed here, or from one you
       create. For instance, you would create a new packet like this:

       <pre>
       PacketBuffer login(PacketBuffer::pcLogin);
       </pre>

       When you want to create your own packet commands, you should create a new
       class and dirive it from PacketBuffer, and start your enumeration from
       pcUser. All ones below pcUser are reserved for furture use. "pc" part 
       stands for Packet Command.

       <pre>
       class ChessPacket : public PacketBuffer
       {
         public:
           pcNewGame = pcUser,  //start your packets at pcUser and up
           pcQuitGame,
           pcStartGame
       };

       ...
       //create a new game packet
       PacketBuffer newGame(ChessPacket::pcNewGame);
       ...
       </pre>
