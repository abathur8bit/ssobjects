       the internal buffer, the internal m_nLength member is set to 0 but the internal string pointer m_pszString is not
       touched. Therefore, calling this function would return the internal pointer. This could also be the case where memory

       allocated if nExtraBytes is not 0. Using the function this way is a good way to dynamically allocate heap memory
       and still have this class free the memory when no longer needed. The allocated memory will be 0 filled. If
       extra bytes are allocated, they will be filled with 0's. If this function is used to allocate memory only (pszString
       set to NULL and nExtraBytes set to non-0), UpdateLength() should be called as soon as the class contains a valid
       string so that future processing using this class is not harmed.
       It should be noted that for string that are not likely to change size, this function differs from Append() by not
       allocating more memory than is required. This does not affect future appends which can still be done, it merely
       means that for strings not likely to change, it uses a more efficient storage scheme. If pszString is not NULL and
       nMaxChars is given, only the number of character specified will be copied to the string, although the extra bytes will
       still be allocated if given. A very slight performance boost can be realized if the length of pszString is known when
       this function is called, and can be specified as the nKnownStringLength parameter. If this function fails to allocate
       memory, it will return NULL, however the previous string held by this class will be left intact and safe.*/

       this class can be used to store non-string data as a string, which could contain embedded 0 terminators, this class cannot
       check the validity of nLength when non-0. Care must be taken here to set the length to the exact length of the data.
