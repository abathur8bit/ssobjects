   \brief Telnet Server object used for creating a full fledged telnet server.


   <B> Overview </B> <br>

   <I>(Documentation modified from SimpleServer)</I>

   Very similar to the SimpleServer class, except data that is read is lines of
   text. Telnet server is a class that you derive from to create a fully
   functional server. The telnet server class handles creating a listen socket,
   reading full lines of text from a client connection, and idling the server.

   You only need to override processSingleMsg() in order to process packets that
   come from a client socket.  idle() is overridden if you want to have an idle
   task. 

   The two ways of constructing a telnet server are for a single-threaded
   server, and a multi-threaded server.

   o Idler        <br>


   <B> Message Pump </B> <br> 

   The message pump is the way the server talks to your code. When data comes
   into the server, it is first parsed into lines of data (searching for "\r\n"
   sequences, and a PacketMessage is created that references the data and the
   socket that it was sent from. It is then posted to the message que. Once
   there, processSingleMsg is called for every line of text that was parsed from
   the incoming data. This is similar to the SimpleServer, except that the read
   data is a string. It is however still put into a PacketBuffer to make working
   with the message pump the same as the SimpleServer. 

   This is where your code comes into play. processSingleMsg will be called with
   a packet command of:

     PacketBuffer::pcNewConnection when a new connection is made to your server.

     PacketBuffer::pcClosed when the connection is terminated.

     TelnetServerSocket::pcFullLine when a full line of text has been read.

   You check what the packet command was, and in the case of a
   TelnetServerSocket::pcFullLine you can then get the zero terminated string
   that was read in with:

     char* pszString = (char*)pmsg->packet()->getBuffer();

   You should not modify the contents of the string. If you need to modify it,
   make a copy and modify the copy. You would then perform some kind of
   operation, and perhaps send a reply back with
   TelnetServerSocket::print/println. This is the process of processing a
   clients request.

   Care should be taken to make sure that when processSingleMsg is called, your
   operations don't take very long. In a single threaded environment, all other
   packets - and there-for all the clients - will waiting for you to process
   thier requests.


   <B> Idler </B> <br>
   Idling is the process of repeating tasks at a regular interval, like having a
   main loop, or more accuratly, like using a WM_TIMER message in Windows. The
   frequency is controlled by the m_nFrequency attribute. 
   
   Override idle() method if you want to do things on a regular basis without
   waiting for a packet from a client. This is prefered over putting the server
   into a busy loop. If the server is in a busy loop, it will not process
   additional packets in a single-threaded environment. You can set how often
   this is called via the frequency attribute.


   <B>Threading</B> <br>
   It is possible to write the server in such a way that it will operate as a
   single-threaded server or a multi-threaded server, and this decision can be
   made at run time. It simply requires a little for-planning, and knowing where
   to put shared data. 

   The reason you would want to have a server capable of running as a single
   or threaded server is for debugging purposes under Linux. Single threading is
   easier to debug. Multi-threaded can give better performance, and is the best
   way to handle lengthy operations.

   Threading requires the use of the SimpleManager object. It's a little
   tricky to setup.


   \note 
   When running multi-threaded, any shared data in your derived classes should
   be in the SimpleManager and passed into the simple server.  If you idle in
   the manager, you should idle the same way in the server. The simple server
   however should check if it is running multi threaded, and only idle shared
   data if it is running single threaded.

        \brief Override this to process data that come in from clients. 

        The server will call this method when there was enough data to have
        parsed it into a full line and needs to have the data processed. A PacketMessage
        object is created to contain both the line read and client socket that send
        the packet. You will typically send your reply to this socket. In
        certain circumstances you will send the reply to all client connections
        such as in the case of a chat message.

        When you override this method, your function will typically look
        something like: 

        <PRE>
        ...
        void
        YourServer::processSingleMsg(PacketMessage* pmsg)
        {
          TelnetServerSocket* psocket = (TelnetServerSocket*)pmsg->socket();
          PacketBuffer* ppacket = pmsg->packet();
          switch(ppacket->getCmd())
          {
            //One way to handle the message. Process and reply within the switch.
            case PacketBuffer::pcNewConnection:   onNewConnection(pmsg);   break;
            case PacketBuffer::pcClosed:          onClosed(pmsg);          break;
            case TelnetServerSocket::pcFullLine:  onFullLine(pmsg);        break;
          }
          DELETE_NULL(ppacket);   //IMPORTANT! The packet is no longer needed. You must delete it.
        }
        ...
        void
        YourServer::onFullLine(PacketMessage* pmsg)
        {
          TelnetServerSocket* psocket = (TelnetServerSocket*)pmsg->socket();
          char* pszString = (char*)pmsg->packet()->getBuffer();
          processCmd(psocket,pszString);
        }
        ...
        </PRE>
