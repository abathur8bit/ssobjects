/**
   \brief
   Socket object that contains both a read and write buffer.

    The Server Socket object contains an incoming buffer for data that is 
    read in and isn't parsed, and an outgoing buffer for data that hasn't 
    been sent. The SimpleServer object uses this object for every connection
    that comes in.

    A ServerHandler object can be stored here for easy access to it from a server
    object that has a number of server socket objects.
